JSP files are located at /mysecondwebapp/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/jsp
I did not spend much time on making a repository or even a user class (I may actually change that)
there are two users that are authenticated in the application user: Ali pass: Ali, user: najaf pass: najaf (no way to make an account right now)
